		Board games, these two words either bring a smile to your face and thoughts of some fun evenings with a bunch of friends, or make you cringe with the thoughts of family arguments and possibly flipped tables and broken furniture (I'm looking at you Monopoly&trade;). I'll be the first to admit I'm a board game addict. Fan is too casual of a term, addiction works. I own games that I haven't even opened or played yet because I thought they looked cool! And I still buy more, just like some people do with books. Yeah I have that problem as well, huge library. Video games are fun, but it's hard to beat a night of gaming around the table. The fights can be pretty fun too. Yes, I've played my fair share of Monopoly&trade;. The kinds of games I have in mind though are pretty different.

		<h2>The First Experience</h2>

			<img src = "images/axis2.jpg" alt = "Axis & Allies">
			<figcaption><span>Axis & Allies &trade;</span>--so it begins!</figcaption>
		</figure>
		</div>
		<p>Our very first experience with an entirely different type of game was when we unboxed Axis & Allies&trade; for the very first time. The cover of the box was an action packed hand painted scene depicting combat during WWII. Fighter planes, battle ships, soldiers, explosions, pure eye candy to a kid of the Rambo generation! Following what eventually became my normal routine after looking at the cover, I turned the box over and was in awe of the hundreds (literally) of little plastic fighter planes, bombers, battleships, aircraft carriers, infantry and tanks that filled the image.</p><p> We rapidly emptied the contents of the box and proceeded to remove every one of those pieces from the plaste sprews they were attached too. I'm pretty sure it took hours, but we didn't care, we just knew this was going to be the greatest game ever. Fast forward about a week later when we finally got around to learning how to play it properly, it really was a great game. A long game, but we would spend hours playing it until somebody won. This actually began my long fascination with all games that have tons of tiny little plastic pieces.

		</div>
		<p>An ever growing collection of various games kept building after that. Not unlike the huge collection of books that you'll "get to eventually", some of these games have yet to be played. They looked cool! What can I say. Having self admitted nerdy art tendencies (admitted here and now for the first time to some), box art goes a long way toward catching my eye initially. Then its a matter of picking up said box, and after admiring the cover, flipping it over and seeing what awaits inside! The usual shots of a game in a mostly set up and half played state appear on the back, and by the time I've seen that, my mind is usually made up.
		</p>
		<p>This all sort of spun out of a healthy fascination with Dungeons & Dragons&trade; as a young man. I'll allow a little laugh and small amount judgement here just this once. It is, at the time, around 1987 I think it was, a fairly complex game. It still is, but this was the post dark ages of first edition. Second edition! So the dark, but not as dark, dark ages. Sometime later, in 1989, my friends and I while at a local game shop, had a first encounter with board games that we had never seen before. We all remembered the ones from when we were kids: Candy Land&trade;, Chutes And Ladders&trade;, Life&trade;, Sorry!&trade;, Stratego&trade; etc. But, these were different. They were complex, but fun. They were stretgic and thoughtful. They were heroic, not cute! War, fighting, aventure, monsters, treasure....what more could a kid ask for? Well, funny you should ask, some things might be:

		<p>Some of that looks familiar, but miniatures and modular design could use some clarification in this case.</p>
		</article>
		
		<dl>
			<dt><span>Miniature Model</span></dt>
				<dd>Scale models called miniature models, which can be anywhere from 2mm to 54mm in height, to represent warriors, vehicles, artillery, buildings, and terrain. These models are colloquially referred to as miniatures or minis.</dd>
			<dt><span>Modular Design</span></dt>
				<dd>A modular game board is a mechanic used in some board games where the board is made up of several smaller sections that can be combined in different ways to create the play area. It can also include other pieces such as doorways, furniture, terrain types, etc.</dd>

		</div>
		
		<p>Where do I start with Hero Quest? This was possibly one of the greatest games of all time. Dungeons & Dragons and Axis & Allies&trade; lead us directly here. The box art jumped out at me immediately. On the cover there was a huge raging barbarian with his broad sword ready, an army of evil monsters in the background ready to spring into action, a wizard casting a spell, and the words HeroQuest emblazoned across the top in a large, imposing, heroic fashion!

		The back of the box, the old reliable place I always go to, did not disappoint. There were tons of pieces! Plastic figures that represented the heroes, skeletons, orcs, goblins, mummies, it was incredible. But, it didnt stop there. There were also doorways, trabs, tables, treasure chests, bookcases, all manner of furnishings. This was a true 3D, modular, dungeon crawling exploration adventure. It also set the tone for what I really loved in a game going forward.

		<p>Quite possibly the greatest reviewer of board games I have ever had the privilege of watching, and pretty much my spirit animal, reviews what makes HeroQuest so great in this video. Highly entertaining, and hard to argue with. I can't stress enough how much of a must watch this is.</p>
